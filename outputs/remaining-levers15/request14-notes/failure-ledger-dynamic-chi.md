# Failure ledger — dynamic chi

Status: Proven. Request 11.1 isolates an omitted-nuisance bias mechanism: with truncated estimator l and omitted orthonormal residual basis D, an unbounded D-component can cancel any fitted beta signal whenever D.T l is nonzero. At fixed nominal Gaussian width, a finite multiplier cannot ensure uniform coverage. Full nuisance fitting removes this specific mean-bias mechanism in the fixed linear model. See [the registered audit result](../notes/REQUEST11_1_NUISANCE_AUDIT_RESULT.md).

Status: Imported from prior work. Request 11.2's full-space diagonal-noise interval reaches only 58.25% pointwise coverage under its specified extra-Fourier stress. Fitting the specified covariance by REML gives minimum coverage 94.59% across the follow-through conditions. This is conditional linear-model evidence; it neither validates all noise nor demonstrates failure of the historical K=10 grid envelope. See [coverage results](../notes/REQUEST11_2_COVERAGE_RESULT.md).

The unified revision supersedes the early runtime proposals formerly summarized here. Dated REQUEST10 notes and raw artifacts preserve the historical gate record; no frozen verdict is rewritten.

| Status | Condition | Exact failing step | Minimal missing ingredient |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Proven | Reciprocal fast-spectrum assumptions absent | Positivity or the rate-gap quadrature inequality need not hold. | Independently justify conjugate readout, positive dissipation and the gap. |

Status: Proven. The analytic outcome is theorem progress: the exact real-carrier interpolation boundary, low-frequency remainder and nuisance-rank condition are explicit. The linear MVP's sideband attempt fails at superposition.

Status: Counterexample candidate. The remaining physical outcome is loophole progress: the shared pole is a candidate only against a restricted comparator and an observable projection that preserves it. Dynamic EFT is established prior art, and A4 is not the unique possible assumption boundary.

Status: Counterexample candidate. Request 11.3 now supplies a force-level EFT realization with explicit validity conditions. Its historical physical-drive interpretation fails a phase gate. This is a recorded boundary result, not a successful empirical scalar-tensor exclusion.

Status: Conjectural. Numerical EOS-to-body matching and a calibrated astrophysical timing likelihood remain outside the completed conditional analysis. They require additional physical inputs and cannot be supplied by prose or a unit-drive rescaling.


## Request 12 follow-through

Status: Imported from prior work. Request 12 half-step timing derivatives change individually by at most 0.6652 percent but rotate weak nuisance directions almost orthogonally; no physical derivative-error certificate follows. A weak 223-day pulse-count compensation demands e>1 at the proposed full-displacement fractions; local admissible probes do not rescue it. Status: Conjectural. Numerical EOS matching, omitted timing-force control and complete nonlinear pulse/noise inference remain incomplete.

## Request 13 remediation

Status: Imported from prior work. Request 13 replaces the prior absence of numerical EOS work with a specified SLy stellar structure and outgoing scalar mode calculation. An initially 0.878% independent mass discrepancy was traced to sparse-table enthalpy construction; resampling the same pressure-energy continuum reduces it to 2.73e-7 relative. Timing bounds-check order is corrected and an algebraically equivalent residual evaluation is tested to reduce cancellation. Tightening integration or interpolation settings alone does not provide a rigorous derivative enclosure. Constrained nonlinear timing/noise fits now run inside physical eccentricity domains, but local optimizer output is not a global pulse reconnection or calibrated physical-signal inference. Outstanding completion gates are maintained in [Request 13 plan](../notes/REQUEST13_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md).

## Request 14 validated flow

Status: Imported from prior work. The new CAPD calculation supplies short-time continuum state and initial-state Jacobian enclosures, plus local independent mass derivatives. Direct Cartesian C1 and Hermite-Obreshkov representations exceed the declared Jacobian-width ceiling near six days; exact unit scaling extends this to about 32 days. Generic Jacobi reconstruction initially fails the remainder-inclusion test because exact common-position cancellation is represented numerically. Eliminating that position dependence algebraically restores validated stepping, with the width ceiling reached at about 45.78 days. None completes the approximately 2990-day forward span. See [raw bounds and remaining failures](../notes/REQUEST14_VALIDATED_VARIATIONAL.md).

Status: Conjectural. The missing links to D2 are a useful whole-span variational enclosure, certified physical parameter initialization including masses, and all timing readout/inverse-time terms. No finite-step agreement, short-time success, or midpoint restart can replace these links. Broad interval bounds diagnose this enclosure method; they do not prove physical orbital instability.
