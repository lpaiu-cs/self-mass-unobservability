| M6.4 | Conjectural | [`docs/theorem-A-freefall.md`](theorem-A-freefall.md) | Electric-only, stronger minimal-sector, and broader collapse statements are separated cleanly. |
| M6.5 | Proven | [`failure-ledger.md`](failure-ledger.md) | The live bottleneck is identified as magnetic-family ordering rather than hidden basis failure. |

## Near-Term Sequence

1. Status: Conjectural. Decide whether magnetic-family ordering should be imposed explicitly or whether the theorem target should be upgraded to the `E/B`-expanded sector.
2. Status: Conjectural. If the `E/B` sector is accepted, attack survivor independence and conditional collapse for the enlarged finite basis rather than preserving an electric-only theorem statement.
3. Status: Conjectural. Decide whether any extra gradient or mixed-trace identity should be introduced explicitly, rather than silently collapsing `divE2`, `mixedGradE2`, `divB2`, or `mixedGradB2`.
4. Status: Counterexample candidate. Promote the dominant loophole class only if it produces a genuine failure of the explicit enumeration or adequacy path.
5. Status: Conjectural. Revisit the scalar `s_A` corollary only after the higher-dimensional sensitivity manifold statement is sharp.

## Explicit Non-Goals For M1

- Status: Proven. No new LLR, MLRS, PEP, Nutimo, or TOA pipeline work belongs in M1.
- Status: Proven. No clock-sector theorem is attempted in M1.
- Status: Proven. No build or runtime chores count as theorem progress.

## Classification Rule

- `theorem progress`: theorem draft, lemma draft, assumption cleanup, symbolic reduction check
- `loophole progress`: explicit counterexample model, exact failed proof step, minimal violated assumption
